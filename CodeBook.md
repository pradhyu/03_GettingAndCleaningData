### Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute Information
For each record in the dataset it is provided: 

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.For each record it is provided:

### Details on Files included in the dataset 
The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

Key Identifiers of output file "./data/tidy_uci_std_mean_average.txt"
#### Each row is identified by 2 keys
	Subject - The ID of the test subject

#### Activity Labels

- WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
- SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
- STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
- LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test


### Summary Choices:

#### Section 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
After setting the source directory for the files, read/load into tables the data located in

- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

Assign column names and merge to create one data set.

#### Section 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Select only the relevant variables for further processing (taking only the derived measurements of the standard deviation and the mean, denoted by the "-std()" or "-mean()" suffix)
Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.
Add the subject and activity ids to the two training and testing data sets, keeping the ordering of the data in the original files

#### Section 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Merge data subset with the activityType table to include the descriptive activity names

####Section 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

#### Section 5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Take the average of all the standard deviation or mean measurements belonging to the specified subject and activity
Per the project instructions, we need to produce only a data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject.
